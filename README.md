## Setup New Project

> [!note]
> Make sure you have [UV installed](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#installation-methods) before you start.

Create new project:

```bash
uvx cookiecutter gh:wyattferguson/pattern
```

Alternatively you can use [Cruft](https://cruft.github.io/cruft/):

```bash
uvx cruft create gh:wyattferguson/pattern
```

Then just follow the prompts, pick the tools you want to install, and watch the magic happen.
